# "Un-safety" nets in software delivery

No one cares about your architecture - they care that it works

No one cares about your tests (if you test, if they pass) - they care that quality is high

No one cares about how many bugs you have - they care about the ones they encounter

_BUT_ ignoring any of the things on the left make it hard to satisfy the conditions on the right

Sprint 0 is an "un-safety" net.  It makes you feel all good inside to get your ducks in a row, build out some architecture, get your servers online, etc.  All the while you're kicking the can of risk down the street because you're not producing anything of business value.
