In every company I've been employed by someone else, every company, I've had a conversation with my employer about trading pay for extra time off.  Often this happened right at the beginning of my employment, a likely uncomfortable situation for my new employer.  To me, when I want time off I'm going to take it.  What I need to know is how that fits in with the vacation policy of my employer.  If I work overtime, can I bank it as PTO instead of getting paid extra?  Can I take leave without pay?  To me, there were always two crucial matters on the table: finding a situation that matches my motivations, and having a seat at the table of decision.

One area employees feel connected to the two matters mentioned above is when they negotiate their salary upon accepting a new job.  Many people want to be paid well and are motivated by finding pay that both more than covers their expenses and for the one-uppers in the world, seems impressive related to the people they know.  Unfortunately for many, this is also the only time they have a seat at the table to impact how they are rewarded.
