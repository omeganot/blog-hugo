In every company I've been employed by someone else, every company, I've had a conversation with my employer about trading pay for extra time off.  Often this happened right at the beginning of my employment, a likely uncomfortable situation for my new employer.  To me, when I want time off I'm going to take it.  What I need to know is how that fits in with the vacation policy of my employer.  If I work overtime, can I bank it as PTO instead of getting paid extra?  Can I take leave without pay?  To me, there were always two crucial matters on the table: finding a situation that matches my motivations, and having a seat at the table of decision.

People are motivated by money in so much as it acts as a proxy for basic needs motivations.  Dan Pink [pointed this out][3] in his book [*Drive*][4] and stated simply that people should be paid enough to take the issue of money off the table.  That's probably a bit more than basic needs for most people in modern society.  They also need compensation that allows them to fulfill personal missions and goals.  That might be to build shelter for low-income families, to sail around the world, or to pick up a new book every week to read over the weekend.  Once people's needs are met money doesn't act as much of a motivator.  In fact, it becomes a demotivator.

## The annual raise - dancing with two left feet
We see the demotivation of money in effect during annual salary adjustments, a ritual dreaded by both employer and employee.  If your salary is adjusted annually, think back to the last year.  How happy were you with the adjustment?  What influence did you have over setting your new salary?  How connected did the change feel to the work that you perform?  If these questions left you feeling a little low, you're not alone.  Employers tend to stick to a formula including things like rank, longevity, annual performance, and variance from market pay.  Feels really tied to your accomplishments, doesn't it?

As much as employees are often left disappointed following an annual salary adjustment, employers bear their fair share of anguish.  If you can't at least provide an annual raise that meets annual cost of living changes you're going to disappoint your workers.  This is table stakes, folks.  For some managers, what they can offer employees monetarily is handicapped by "corporate" before they even have an opportunity to consider what pay meets an employee's contributions.  And as Erik Weber [points out][1], if this evaluation of performance and salary are happening at an annual rate, you're behind the curve.

## Beyond annual pay
GE is [beginning their shift][2] away from annual raises much like they shifted away from annual performance reviews.  When rewards are temporally related to the actions taken and tied to actionable feedback, they are much more impactful.  But while the frequency of rewards is just one part of the equation, as we explored above pay only goes so far.  What might people really want?  Some know that work happens anywhere, anytime, so play should be the same way.  Some might want the chance to do something outrageous in pursuit of the mission and should be acknowledged and rewarded for that [*even if they fail*][7].  Some want their pay to be updated as frequent as their competencies and contributions to the organization increase.  Regardless of what any specific incentives a person may be swayed by, we all want the same thing at the core - *to be compensated appropriately, and fairly, for the value we bring to our organizations.*

The transition away from annual salary adjustments as the primary means to compensate people in ways that matter to them and let people know they are valued does not have to be a drastic one, nor even a costly one.  [Kudo cards][8] and [merit money][9] can be great starters to increasing feedback cycles along with simple rewards, and companies like [Bonus.ly][10] provide tools to support such practices.
