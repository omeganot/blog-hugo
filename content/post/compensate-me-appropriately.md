In every company I've been employed by someone else, every company, I've had a conversation with my employer about trading pay for extra time off.  Often this happened right at the beginning of my employment, a likely uncomfortable situation for my new employer.  To me, when I want time off I'm going to take it.  What I need to know is how that fits in with the vacation policy of my employer.  If I work overtime, can I bank it as PTO instead of getting paid extra?  Can I take leave without pay?  To me, there were always two crucial matters on the table: finding a situation that matches my motivations, and having a seat at the table of decision.

One area employees feel connected to the two matters mentioned above is when they negotiate their salary upon accepting a new job.  Many people want to be paid well look for pay which more than covers their expenses, and for the one-uppers in the world seems impressive related to the people they know.  Unfortunately for many, this is also the only time they have a seat at the table to impact how they are rewarded.

Looking at motivation related to compensation, we know that people are motivated by money in so much as it acts as a proxy for basic needs motivations.  Dan Pink [pointed this out][3] after pulling together lots of economic research in his book *[Drive][4]*.  People need to make sure their needs are met, and beyond that money doesn't act as a motivator so much.  In fact, it becomes a demotivator.

We see the demotivation of money in effect during annual salary adjustments.  Both the employer and the employee are demotivated by them.  If your salary is adjusted annually, think back to the last time it was updated.  How happy were you with the adjustment?  What influence did you have over setting your new salary?  How connected did the change feel to the work that you perform?

GE is [beginning their journey][2] into the shift away from annual raises as they look towards compensating people according to what works for them individually.
