Recently I had the pleasure of joining a few of my fellow [Scrum.org PSTs][1] for a face-to-face gathering in Columbus, OH.  Our community meets several times a year in this way to deepen relationships, share knowledge, and tackle problems facing our group.  One such topic that came up in one of our open spaces was the scaling of retrospectives.

Having a retrospective is an important part of the inspect/adapt loop for any team.  No matter the batch size of your work, from one item at a time to a month's worth of work, it can be helpful for people to periodically and regularly look at how they're operating and ask what they could change in their personal or work process to make things a bit better.  That self introspection can be daunting for many, even with a team of people that work closely with and trust each other.  When expanding this to many teams, the challenges expand immensely beyond teasing out the quiet voice.  How does information get processed by the group?  How do they figure out what to take action on?  How are they accountable for their actions?

### Gathering data
For the group to figure out what they should improve, they first need to gather information.  Just like regular retrospectives, starting out with the [Retrospective Prime Directive][2] can be a great way to bring everyone together to share information transparently and not turn teams against each other.

One simple technique is to split the group.  This seems counter-intuitive since we just brought all these disparate teams together!  Try instead to split not on team lines.  Perhaps split once using a simple exercise.  Task these groups to come up with topics to discuss.  Bring the information back tot he group as a whole, then reform into new teams based on affinity to topics that people want to discuss.  While you may still end up with large groups, you will certainly know which topics seem most important to the group.

Another suggestion that co-trainer [Dan Sloan][3] offered up was the [1-2-4 All][4] technique.  This activity starts off with people individually coming up with their own ideas and writing them down.  They then pair up and build on those ideas.  They pair again, now in foursomes, and develop the pair ideas further.  Finally, each foursome shares back with the group one important item from their discussion.

### Keep the focus on the system
When having a scaled retrospective, it's important that participants keep their discussion focused on the system as a whole.  The natural tendency for people is to bring up issues that are affecting them or their team that they want solved for that same group.  There's a time and place for this, and it's in the team's own retrospective.  Teams need time to sort out problems unique to their own group, problems which may or may not exist across the collection of teams.

Focusing on things which only affect the entire group of teams can help to remove a "that's not my problem" attitude.

### Elect representatives
One way to keep the group size managable is to only have elected representatives from each team participate.  Each team elects members from their own team, number of people pre-determined by the group at large, to represent their insights and ideas to the larger audience.  Electing from within empowers teams to select someone who they trust and empowers the individual(s) selected to take action on behalf of the team.  Teams may also want to experiment with [Delegation Poker][5] to let their elected representatives what they expect in terms of information and decision making authority.

### Getting to action
Here's another place in which the [Retrospective Prime Directive][2] comes in handy.  We must believe that the people who participated in the retrospective did the best job they could and we should honor them for that.  Decisions they made are the best they could come up with, and it would at least be worth trying their actions.  We can always make another change at a later time once we've learned more from their plan of action.

Finally, when it comes down to *who* takes on the action item(s), this does not necessarily have to be the responsibility of every member of every team.  Some action items may only require the dedicated efforts of a few individuals to make some progress and help the group out as a whole.  Teams need to give those who shoulder this responsibility the time and support needed to accomplish these goals.  It may cause strain on their specific team, yet their efforts are expected to provide more value to all than the cost of that struggle by one team.
